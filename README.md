For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:
 
(5) Create a database ( fswd13_cr11_petadoption_yourname) initially with 2 tables: users and animals. Add sufficient test data in the animals table: at least 10 records in total between small animals and large animals. Remember that animals have their age so make sure there are at least 4 senior animals in the DB (older than 8 years old).

(20) Display all animals on a single web page (home.php). Make sure a nice GUI is presented here(backenders exempt)

(15) Display all senior animals. Here you can decide whether to create a filter on the home page or create a new page senior.php

(15) Create a show more/show details button that will lead to a new page with only the information from that specific record/animal.

(15) Create a registration and login system.

Create separate sessions for normal users and administrators.

(15)Normal Users:

They will be able to ONLY see(read) and access all data. No action buttons (create, edit or delete) should be available.

(15) Admin:

Only the admin is able to create, update and delete data about animals (not users) within the admin panel, therefore an Admin Panel/Dashboard  should be created.
